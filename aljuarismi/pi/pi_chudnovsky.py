We have still got a long way to go though, and we'll have to improve both our 
algorithm (formula) for π and our implementation.

The current darling of the π world is the Chudnovsky algorithm which is similar 
to the arctan formula but it converges much quicker. It is also rather complicated. 
The formula itself is derived from one by Ramanjuan who's work was 
extraordinary in the extreme.
