### Defining project

#### Contactâ€™s details
* name
* address
* phone number
* email address


#### Funcionalities
* save
* update
* delete
* list
* sort
* get
* Allow users to list contacts using different parameters, such as alphabetical order or contact creation date.
* Export to excel or csv.
* Backup the database to an online storage platform. To do this, you can upload the database files to the cloud at certain intervals. You can also add a command that allows users to backup the database themselves.
* you may need some form of identification, so the contact book can tell which database file belongs to which user. Implementing a user authentication feature is one way to go about it.


#### Tasks
1. Set up the commands users can use to enter the contact details.
   save (-s), update (-u), delete (-d), list (-l), sort (-o), get (-g)
2. Use the argparse or click command-line frameworks.

   contact [name] [address] [phone] [email] -s -u
   contact -l
   contact -d [name] [phone] [email]
   contact -g [name] [address] [phone] [email]
